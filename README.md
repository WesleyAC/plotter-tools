# plotter-tools

Some tools for interacting with pen plotters that use HPGL (or G-Code, in a [strange case](https://trmm.net/Plotter)).

## Getting Started

Before using any of these, you'll need to install the Rust toolchain - you can
do that by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

## `chunker`

`chunker` is used to communicate with the pen plotter.

It gets around the plotters 60 byte buffer, by taking in a file of HP-GL
commands, and sending each one to the plotter punctuated by a `OA` command,
then waiting to send the next command to the plotter until a response has been
received. This allows sending large files to the plotter without overflowing
the internal buffer. The `chunker` command also prepends `IN;` to the entire
file, initializing the plotter.

To use `chunker`:

* `cd` into the `chunker` directory
* Run `cargo build`
* You many need to install `libudev-dev` or a similar package if it fails to
  build
* Run `sudo ./target/debug/chunker /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/path/to/your/hpgl/file`

And your file should print!

If you're using a Mac, install [this driver](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&pcid=41)
and replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with `/dev/tty.usbserial`.

If you run into mysterious problems, try disconnecting and reconnecting the
plotter before running the `chunker` command.

## `viz`

There is also a `viz` command, which makes a html document showing a debug
visualisation of what the output of a command will look like. It takes a single
input file argument, and outputs a html document to stdout. Currently, it only
supports the `PU`, `PD`, `PA`, `PR`, and `SP` commands. The `IN` command is
treated as a nop.

To run it:

* `cd` into the `viz` directory
* Run `cargo run -- ~/path/to/your/file.hpgl > /tmp/some_file.html`
* Open `file:///tmp/some_file.html` in your web browser

## `convert.py`

`convert.py` converts a HP-GL file that is in only absolute movements to one
that is in only relative movements. It is very limited - it only works on files
that have one command per line, don't use `PD` or `PU` to move the pen, and
only use `PA` movement commands with a single position as a parameter. I use
it, in addition to some vim macros to convert HP-GL files outputted by inkscape
to ones that can be used at arbitrary points in a script. It's pretty janky
right now, improvements are appreciated <3

## `typewriter`

`typewriter` generates plotting instructions that render text on the page, for
a font on your computer. Unfortunately, due to limitations in `rusttype`, it
only supports LTR text and `ttf` font files for now. The output assumes that
the correct pen is already selected. You may also want to set the velocity so
that straight lines and curves are plotted with the same darkness — `VS 2;`
seems to work well.

To use `typewriter`:

* `cd` into the `typewriter` directory
* Run `cargo run -- <x> <y> <font size> "your text here" /path/to/font/file.ttf > yourfile.hgpl`

## `hpgl2gcode`

`hpgl2gcode` converts HPGL programs to G-Code programs that can be plotted on
the [plotter at NYC Resistor](https://trmm.net/Plotter). To use it:

* `cd` into the `hpgl2gcode` directory
* Run `cargo run -- ~/path/to/your/file.hpgl > ~/path/to/your/file.gcode`
* You can then use [ReplicatorG](http://replicat.org/) to send the gcode file to the plotter.

It applies a scale factor to both axes as well - currently, it is not
configurable without changing the source, but pull requests are welcome :) The
HPGL -> Gcode step is the correct step to apply the scale factor at, since HPGL
is integer-only, and thus suffers from more rounding problems than Gcode.

## `adapter`

The `adapter` directory contains some OpenSCAD code to generate a 3d model of an
adapter that allows for the use of pens other than the vintage HP plotter pens.
It's based on [Jean-Philippe Côté's model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2955469).

In order to make holders for new pens, you'll need to install OpenSCAD, open
`adapter.scad`, and add a new module for the pen you want to add. If you make
one that works, pleas submit a PR! I'm very excited to try new pens :)

We've found that SLA machines have good enough resolution to print these, and
Jean-Philippe [mentions](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kDwyCi3l2R6) that
using a SLS machine with PA12 nylon seems to work well. I think that it's
unlikely that a typical hobbyist FDM machine would be accurate enough to work
well, but I haven't tried it.

The OpenSCAD adapter is designed to allow for the use of 3 M4 fine-pitch set
screws - for instance, [McMaster-Carr part #90751A115](https://www.mcmaster.com/90751a115)
should work well, although this entire design is untested :)
